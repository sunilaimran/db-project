--- FIND OUT ALL REGIONS EXPECT THE REGION WITH REGION_NAME OF Americas

-- HOW TO USE NULL IN CONDITION ?
-- FOR EXAMPLE : FIND OUT ALL DEPARTMENTS THAT DOES NOT HAVE MANAGER_ID
SELECT * FROM DEPARTMENTS
WHERE MANAGER_ID IS NULL ; -- 16 ROWS

-- FOR EXAMPLE : FIND OUT ALL DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE MANAGER_ID
SELECT * FROM DEPARTMENTS
WHERE MANAGER_ID IS NOT NULL ; -- 11 ROWS

-- SORTING THE RESULT IN ASCENDING (LOW TO HIGH )
--  OR DESCENDING ORDER(HIGH TO LOW )
-- ORDER BY Clause can be used to order the result of your query
-- It use either column name or column index
-- It must be the last part of the statement
-- ASC for (LOW TO HIGH ) by default ,
-- DESC  (HIGH TO LOW )

-- Display Employee FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME and Salary
-- try to sort by below criteria separately
-- FIRST_NAME ASC
-- Salary DESC
-- LAST_NAME DESC
SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES
--ORDER BY FIRST_NAME ASC;
ORDER BY SALARY DESC ;
--ORDER BY LAST_NAME DESC ;
-- ORDER BY 1 DESC ; -- THIS MEANS SORT THE RESULT BY FIRST COLUMN
-- SQL INDEX START WITH 1 NOT 0 !!!!!!!!!!!!!




-- WHAT ABOUT THE PARTIAL SEARCH
-- WE USE LIKE AND % (WILD CARD)
--  % can represent 0 or more character of any kind
--  _ can represent exactly one character of any kind

-- DISPLAY ALL THE FIRST_NAME THAT START WITH LETTER A IN EMPLOYEES TABLES
SELECT FIRST_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A%' ; -- 10 ROWS

-- DISPLAY ALL THE FIRST_NAME THAT END WITH LETTER a IN EMPLOYEES TABLES
SELECT FIRST_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '%a'  ;  -- 16 ROWS


-- DISPLAY ALL THE FIRST_NAME THAT CONTAINS LETTER a IN EMPLOYEES TABLES
SELECT FIRST_NAME
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '%a%'  ;  -- 66 ROWS
--% (0 or more char) a( letter a) % (0 or more char) = contains logic.
-- You can use % more than one time wherever and when needed
-- to represent 0 or more characters
