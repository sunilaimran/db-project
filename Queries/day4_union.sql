  In order for SET Operators to work ,
Two tables or result of two query being used MUST HAVE
- same exact column count
- same exact column data type
- Ideally  same exact column name (if not first table column name will be used)
Unlike JOIN which require primary key and foreign key relationship,
SET Operator must have above pre-requisite or it will not work at all !
JOIN and SET Operators are two completely different concepts.
CREATE TABLE FIRST_TABLE AS (
    SELECT FIRST_NAME , SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES
    WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 10500 AND 13000

    WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 12000 AND 24000
